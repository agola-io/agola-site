## Contribute

In order to check the web site on your local computer before you send your contribution you'll need to

* install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Then you need to install [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) and all the other dependencies using:

```
pnpm install
```

and run the web server locally:

```
pnpm run docs:dev
```

It will compile the site, start a small server, and let you know the url to open.
